In order to build the Diff program and execute unit tests, run the following command first:
> build

Note: 
This downloads Maven and runs "mvn clean package", which builds a jar file and executes all unit tests.
Including Maven in the tarball would have made it a lot larger.
The Maven installation is from here: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation

Once this is done, you should be able to use the "run-diff" script, which takes 2 parameters (the full paths to the source and target files to diff).
Example:
> run-diff /full/path/to/sourceFile /full/path/to/targetFile
